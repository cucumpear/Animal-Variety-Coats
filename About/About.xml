  <description>Ever wondered if animals really should all have the same shades?
  I sure did, so I utilized the assembly from Animal Collab Project to give vanilla animals a bit of variation. The assembly was created by thirite and has been updated by Xen.
  Now in collaboration with Azrael!
  Note that this will conflict with any mod that overrides these animals' textures.</description>
